### **Algorithm**
  
## Cgame
Repository for the semester project of the programming methods lab, it consists in helping spiderman to solve a puzzle in the city by implementing several techniques seen during the lecture, such as state space search, problem subdivision, etc.


## Changelog


### Friday May 7th, 2021

* The theoretical framework of the problem is developed, the points are analyzed and the possible solution to the problem is established, some diagrams are included and also some programming methods are postulated to solve the problem based on an algorithm.


### Monday Jun 7th, 2021

* The developers introduce themselves and the general progress of the project, the objective is to cover all the problems based on an algorithm was the main objective, the problem is divided into more subproblems.

* The investigation of the search method for state spaces to solve the problem begins.

           
### Monday Jul 5th, 2021

* An algorithm is developed that solves a part of the problem in the Python programming language. In addition, a prototype of the algorithm is made in Excel.

* Search in state spaces is implemented for the creation of the matrix and is discarded of the project, we proceed to the investigation and study of the search method in solution space for the development of the algorithm and the solution.

* The overall progress of the project was documented.

### Monday Aug 23th, 2021
* Final solution was implemented.
